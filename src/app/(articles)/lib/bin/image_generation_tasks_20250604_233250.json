    "image_generation_prompt": "Create a vector art illustration in a clean and bright style. The scene is inside a pharmacy. A Japanese tourist, looking slightly unwell but hopeful, is at the counter speaking to a friendly and reassuring pharmacist of diverse ethnicity. The pharmacist is listening attentively. Subtle, stylized icons representing common cold symptoms (like a cough, a thermometer for fever, a sore throat icon) could be gently floating near the tourist. In the background, shelves are neatly stocked with various medicine boxes and packages. The overall atmosphere should be supportive, calm, and optimistic, emphasizing that help is available and communication is key to getting the right medicine. Avoid overly complex details or text, but a simple 'Pharmacy' sign or 'Cold & Flu' section label could be subtly visible. Focus on the positive interaction between the two characters.",
