    "image_generation_prompt": "Vector art style. A young Japanese student, looking focused and confident, speaks into a studio microphone for a TOEFL speaking test. Above their head, three distinct thought bubbles: one contains a magnifying glass over a detailed point (symbolizing 'deep reasoning'), another shows a branching diagram (for 'structured arguments'), and the third depicts a small, vivid personal story icon (like a tiny comic panel showing an achievement, for 'specific examples'). The background is a clean, modern, slightly abstract representation of a sound booth or a study environment, using a palette of encouraging and calm colors like blues, greens, and a touch of optimistic yellow. No text in the image. Emphasize clarity, intelligence, and a positive, aspirational mood.",
