    "image_generation_prompt": "A realistic photo capturing a hopeful moment for a young Japanese international student at a US university. The student, an adult in their early twenties, is sitting at a desk in a bright, modern library or student lounge, with a laptop open to what looks like an online application form (no specific text visible). They are holding a pen and thoughtfully looking at the screen. Nearby, a graduation cap rests on a stack of books. The atmosphere is optimistic and forward-looking, symbolizing the transition from academic life to a professional career in the US. Soft, natural light fills the scene. Focus on the student's determined yet calm expression.",
