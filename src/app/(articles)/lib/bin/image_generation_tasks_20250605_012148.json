    "image_generation_prompt": "Vector art style: A thoughtful adult Japanese person (man or woman, mid-30s to 40s) sits at a desk, looking curious and engaged with a book or tablet displaying abstract representations of language structure. A subtle, glowing brain icon or a network of light connecting the person to the learning material could symbolize understanding. Minimalist speech bubbles with simple English words like 'Hello' or 'Learn' can be present. The background is a clean, modern, inspiring learning space. Use a bright, optimistic color palette. The image should evoke curiosity about second language acquisition theories and motivate adult learners. No prominent text needed. Focus on the 'aha!' moment of understanding.",
