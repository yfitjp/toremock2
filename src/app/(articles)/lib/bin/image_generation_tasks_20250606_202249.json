    "image_generation_prompt": "A clean and bright vector art illustration depicting a university professor's office hour. A friendly, middle-aged Japanese male professor is sitting at his desk, smiling and listening attentively. A young Japanese female student is sitting opposite him, holding an open notebook and pen, asking a question with a curious and respectful expression. The office is tidy and academic, with a bookshelf filled with books, a whiteboard with some simple diagrams (no text), and a window showing a green campus. The overall atmosphere is positive, encouraging, and focused on learning. The color palette should be warm and inviting, using blues, greens, and natural wood tones. No text or letters should appear anywhere in the image. This is a scene of effective and positive academic communication.",
