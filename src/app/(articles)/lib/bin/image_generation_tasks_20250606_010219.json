The image should depict a clear visual contrast between dormitory life and apartment living. On one side, show a vibrant and communal dormitory scene: perhaps a Japanese student interacting cheerfully with diverse international students in a common room, books and laptops around, a sense of shared experience. On the other side, portray a calm and private apartment setting: the same Japanese student peacefully studying or relaxing in a personalized, tidy room with a window view, conveying independence and focus. Use a split-screen effect or a path diverging to represent the choice. The style should be modern, clean, and inviting, with a bright and optimistic color palette. Ensure no text is visible in the image. The Japanese student should be clearly identifiable as such, perhaps through subtle cues in appearance or belongings, but avoid stereotypes. The overall feeling should be one of making an informed decision for a positive study abroad experience.",
