    "image_generation_prompt": "A clean, hopeful vector art illustration. A young Japanese female student is politely handing a folder of documents to a kind, middle-aged Japanese male professor in his bright, organized university office. The student is slightly bowing, showing respect. The professor is smiling warmly, ready to accept the documents. The scene should convey a sense of trust, respect, and academic mentorship. No text or letters on the documents or anywhere in the image. The background shows a bookshelf filled with books and a window with a view of a green campus. The overall color palette is bright and positive.",
