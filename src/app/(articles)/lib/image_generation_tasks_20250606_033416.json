The student sits at a desk with a headset and microphone. A subtle, glowing outline of a speech template (e.g., simple boxes labeled 'Intro,' 'Reason 1,' 'Example,' 'Conclusion') could appear as a holographic projection or a light sketch in a thought bubble, symbolizing a strategic approach. The background features a softly blurred study environment with a hint of an upward-trending graph or a stylized brain with interconnected nodes, representing improved fluency and structure. The overall mood is positive, encouraging, and conveys a sense of mastering a skill. Use a clean, modern vector style with a professional yet engaging color palette (e.g., blues, greens, with a touch of orange for highlights). Ensure the image is visually appealing and sparks curiosity about effective TOEFL speaking strategies. Avoid text within the image, except perhaps very minimal and abstract representations of structure if absolutely necessary.",
